### Further analysis thoughts

Vaccination is the best protection against Delta.“All viruses evolve over time and undergo changes as they spread and replicate,”

1. As per the articles above,  
`The first Delta case in the United States was diagnosed in March and it is now the dominant strain in the U.S.`
2. Delta is the name for the B.1.617.2. variant, a SARS-CoV-2 mutation that originally surfaced in India. 
The first Delta case was identified in December 2020, and the strain spread rapidly, 
soon becoming the dominant strain of the virus in both India and then Great Britain. 
3. Delta is spreading 50% faster than Alpha, which was 50% more contagious than the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, he says. “In a completely unmitigated environment—where no one is vaccinated or wearing masks—it’s estimated that the average person infected with the original coronavirus strain will infect 2.5 other people,” Dr. Wilson says. “In the same environment,
 Delta would spread from one person to maybe 3.5 or 4 other people.”
4. Create a heatmap of vaccinated and unvaccinated people.
In the U.S., there is a disproportionate number of unvaccinated people in Southern and Appalachian states including Alabama, 
Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, and West Virginia, where vaccination rates are low (in some of these states, the number of cases 
is on the rise even as some other states are lifting restrictions because their cases are going down).
5. Link it to a bar chart of percentile points gained in last elections bar chart with red and blue bars

Choropleths are thematic maps where a geographic region has a uniform color based on a metric. Colors correspond to categories defined by numeric ranges. These are often called heatmaps, but that isn't entirely accurate. The key difference between choropleth maps and heat maps is the shape of colored areas. In choropleths, shapes are defined by standard geographical boundaries, not by the data itself. A true geographic heatmap is an isopleth map (has data drawn shapes) 
that depict hotspots on a map to present concentrations of values.
